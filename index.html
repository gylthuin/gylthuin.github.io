<p>You are not the favoured child of fate, neither are you the end of what will be. You are a cog in a machine, a footnote in a larger experiment, and undetermined mode in an undetermined world, non deterministic and divisive, the chaos of creation at its crux. You are a human, foibles, ego, confusion and woefully inadequate communication skills all wrapped in a single veneer of insecurity.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world.</p>

<p>What does all of that mean? Not much, other than that you've found your way to someone who loves words, and perhaps isn't quite able to share properly. I'll do my best to let you know what's on my mind - some of it may be useful, some of it may be frustrating. Most of it will be unnecessarily verbose. And opinionated.</p>

<h1>
<a id="really-what-the-fuck" class="anchor" href="#really-what-the-fuck" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Really, what the fuck?</h1>

<p>I'm .g.raham - I've done a couple of things - all of which sound far more significant than they actually are. I talk about them, and other things I might do, here.</p>
